# User-Interface-for-functional-model-Elevator

Design and construct the User Interface for the control box in a functional model elevator. Worked in a team of 5 to dedign the UI such that the interface output is delivered to the state machine to move the elevator to the respective floor.

Implementation involves the usage of SoftSerial Library to establish communication with Arduino using C language.
